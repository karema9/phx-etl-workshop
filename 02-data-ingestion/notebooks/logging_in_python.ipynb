But on production, you only want to know about errors, in which case you can add more filters (i.e. the funnel gets much more narrow).\n",

You can (and should) define your own logger by creating an object of the Logger class, especially if your application has multiple modules. Let’s have a look at some of the classes and functions in the module.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most commonly used classes defined in the logging module are the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `Logger`: This is the class whose objects will be used in the application code directly to call the functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `LogRecord`: Loggers automatically create LogRecord objects that have all the information related to the event being logged, like the name of the logger, the function, the line number, the message, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `Handler`: Handlers send the LogRecord to the required output destination, like the console or a file. Handler is a base for subclasses like StreamHandler, FileHandler, SMTPHandler, HTTPHandler, and more. These subclasses send the logging outputs to corresponding destinations, like sys.stdout or a disk file.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `Formatter`: This is where you specify the format of the output by specifying a string format that lists out the attributes that the output should contain.\n",
        "\n",
        "we'll talk more in depth about all of these below, right now we're keeping to the basics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Out of these, we mostly deal directly with the objects of the Logger class, which are instantiated using the module-level function `logging.getLogger(name)`. Multiple calls to `getLogger()` with the same name will return a reference to the same Logger object, which saves us from passing the logger objects to every part where it’s needed.\n",

        "Now let’s look at the other extreme. Imagine you are working with the _OpenBurrito SDK_, a library solving the crucial problem of finding a late-night burrito joint near your current location. Suppose it has a function called `find_burrito_joints()` that normally returns a list of suitable restaurants. But under certain rare circumstances, it may raise an exception called `BurritoCriteriaConflict`.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from openburrito import find_burrito_joints, BurritoCriteriaConflict\n",

        "    places = list()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The pattern here is to optimistically execute some code—the call to `find_burrito_joints()`, in this case—within a try block. In the event a specific exception type is raised, you log a message, deal with the situation, and move on.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key difference is the except clause. With the Big Tarp, you’re basically catching and logging any possible exception. With Pinpoint, you are catching a very specific exception type, which has semantic relevance at that particular place in the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice also, that I use `logger.warn()` rather than `logger.exception()`. In other words, I log a message at a particular severity instead of logging the whole stack trace.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why am I throwing away the stack trace information? Because it is not as useful in this context, where I’m catching a specific exception type, which has a clear meaning in the logic of the code. For example, in this snippet:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "characters = {\"hero\": \"Homer\", \"villain\": \"Mr. Burns\"}\n",

        "Here, the `KeyError` is not just any error. When it is raised, that means a specific situation has occurred—namely, there is no “sidekick” role defined in my cast of characters, so I must fall back to a default. Filling up the log with a stack trace is not going to be useful in this kind of situation. And that is where you will use Pinpoint.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The “Transformer” Pattern\n",
        "Here, you are catching an exception, logging it, then raising a different exception. First, here’s how it works in Python 3:\n",

        "\n",
        "(That turns out to have big implications. More on that in a moment.) You will want to use this pattern when an exception may be raised that does not map well to the logic of your application. This often occurs around library boundaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, imagine you are using the openburrito SDK for your killer app that lets people find late-night burrito joints. The `find_burrito_joints()` function may raise `BurritoCriteriaConflict` if we’re being too picky. This is the API exposed by the SDK, but it does not conveniently map to the higher-level logic of your application. A better fit at this point of the code is an exception you defined, called `NoMatchingRestaurants`.\n",

        "\n",
        "This may be most useful in troubleshooting—when you are getting an exception, but trying to better understand the calling context.
