### Different log levels in Python

- **DEBUG** - detailed information, typically of interest, when diagnosing problems
- **INFO** -confirmation that things are working as expected
- **WARNING** - an indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future
e.g (low disk space)
- **ERROR** - due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function
- **CRITICAL** - A serious error indicating that the problem itself maybe unable to continue running.
