### Open Notify

**Open Notify** is an open source project to provide a 
simple programming interface for some of NASAâ€™s awesome data. I do some 
of the work to take raw data and turn them into [APIs](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/api-good-technology-explained/) related to space and spacecraft.



#### ISS position

For demonstration purposes, you are to extract the current position of the ISS, at certain intervals and write the coordinates in a Pandas dataframe. The entire process is  automated using Prefect.
